# Project TODO List: TypeScript Express.js Backend with Prisma

This file documents the requirements and progress for building a TypeScript Express.js backend with Prisma ORM in a monorepo structure with shareable packages.

## Project Setup (Based on Original Requirements)

- [x] Create monorepo structure with Express, TypeScript, and Prisma
- [x] Set up project files and directories
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- [x] Initialize Express server with necessary middlewares
- [x] Set up Prisma with SQLite database
- [x] Configure shared packages structure

## Architecture

- [x] Follow modern web application patterns and best practices
- [x] Put as much of the app in the frontend as possible (backend for data persistence and API calls)
- [x] Minimize the number of files and collapse similar components
- [x] Implement both frontend and backend functionality
- [x] Structure code in a maintainable monorepo format

## Data Model & Types

- [x] Define data model in `shared/schema.ts` for consistency between frontend and backend
- [x] Keep the data model simple (only essential fields)
- [x] Implement insert schema using `createInsertSchema` from `drizzle-zod`
- [x] Define insert type using `z.infer<typeof insertSchema>`
- [x] Define select type using `typeof table.$inferSelect`
- [x] Use proper array column definitions
- [x] Ensure type safety across frontend and backend

## Storage Implementation

- [x] Set up SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- [x] Configure database connection and schema
- [x] Implement necessary data access methods for CRUD operations
- [x] Ensure storage interface uses types from shared schema
- [x] Implement database migrations

## Backend API

- [x] Implement API routes in `server/routes.ts`
- [x] Use storage interface for CRUD operations
- [x] Keep routes as thin as possible (business logic in storage layer)
- [x] Validate request bodies using Zod schemas before passing to storage
- [x] Implement proper error handling for all endpoints
- [x] Set up HTTP server to handle requests
- [x] Create health check endpoint

## Frontend Implementation

- [x] Set up routing with `wouter`
- [x] Register pages in `client/src/App.tsx`
- [x] Create a navigation system (navbar/sidebar)
- [x] Implement forms using shadcn's `useForm` hook and `Form` component
- [x] Use `zodResolver` for form validation
- [x] Set up `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
- [x] Configure queries with proper types
- [x] Implement mutations with proper cache invalidation
- [x] Show loading/skeleton states during async operations
- [x] Handle form submission and error states

## Styling & Theming

- [x] Configure custom theme in `theme.json`
- [x] Use existing shadcn + Tailwind CSS setup
- [x] Create responsive grid-based design
- [x] Use icons from `lucide-react` for actions and visual cues

## Documentation

- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Document API endpoints
- [x] Provide setup and running instructions
- [x] Create TODO.md with project status

## Current Status

- [x] Project structure set up (client, server, shared packages)
- [x] Database configuration and connection established
- [x] User model and schema defined
- [x] Complete CRUD API for users implemented
- [x] Frontend pages for listing and creating users
- [x] Form validation working
- [x] Proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Backend-frontend connection working
- [x] Documentation completed

## Future Improvements (Based on "What's Next?" Section)

- [ ] Add linting & code formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Implement authentication (JWT or session-based)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for production
- [ ] Consider Dockerizing for consistent development environment
- [ ] Add advanced filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets
- [ ] Add more entities and relationships to the data model
- [ ] Improve error handling with more specific error messages
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Implement data caching strategies
