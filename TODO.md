## Architecture

- [x] Follow modern web application patterns and best practices
- [x] Implement modular controllers, services, and routes
- [x] Create utility packages for error handling 
- [x] Structure code in a maintainable monorepo format
- [x] Implement clean separation between frontend and backend
- [x] Create shared types and schemas for consistency

## Data Model & Types

- [x] Define data model in Prisma schema
- [x] Create shared types for frontend and backend
- [x] Implement validation schemas with Zod
- [x] Organize types in dedicated modules
- [x] Set up user and authentication models
- [x] Ensure type safety across the application
- [x] Implement proper database relations

## Database & Storage

- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM

- [x] Add user status management (active/disabled/suspended)
- [x] Implement role-based authorization

## Backend API

- [x] Structure routes in dedicated modules
- [x] Implement controllers for request handling
- [x] Create services for business logic

- [x] Display proper loading and error states

## Code Organization

- [x] Separate concerns with proper layering
- [x] Improve maintainability with module organization
- [x] Create reusable utility functions
- [x] Document code with JSDoc comments
- [x] Follow consistent naming conventions
- [x] Structure shared folder with types and schemas

## Documentation

- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Document API endpoints
- [x] Provide setup and running instructions
- [x] Maintain current TODO.md with project status
- [x] Add inline code documentation

## Current Status
